# React and typescript Recipe finder

## Plan Outline

- create a recipe suggester using react and typescript
- search for an ingredient and then display results for all recipes that include the ingredient
- use recipe API

**Components**
- search bar - do input boxes need to go into a form?
- A Search button
- A Recipe card - map through the recipes and display 10 random results e.g.

**API**
- Async & Await
-  API: EDAMAM

**Plan**

SEARCH COMPONENT
- add an input field and button to jsx, wrap inside form
- add an onChange handler to record the input value and store it in state as a string
- create an onSubmit handler to captures the onChange saved state & resets the onchange state back to ""
